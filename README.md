# EngieHub

EngieHub is a Roblox script hub with both a serversided and an FE-safe option. Its goal is to have over **1,000** scripts, both serverside and FE.
It is designed to be simple for anyone with basic Roblox scripting knowledge to add a script.

## Why EngieHub?

EngieHub is currently the largest script hub on Roblox. CMD-X, one of the biggest FE admin scripts, only has 600 (at the time of editing, this is also ironic because we have CMD-X in EngieHub). EngieHub is also designed to be highly customisable, and take advantage of custom executor features like fireclickdetector() and savefile(), along with a "soft executor" that can run custom loadstring() scripts if need be.

## Games

Some popular game scripts will be added to the executor, such as:

* Adopt Me
* Jailbreak
* Prison Life
* Shindo Life
* Phantom Forces
* Arsenal

Of course, this is not the complete list. There are more games available, and more constantly added.
